provides some aliases to get a consistent interface.

=head1 ACCESSORS

=over 4

=item Name

Name of customer for this address.

=item AddressLine1

=item AddressFieldOne

=item address1

This is a field where Amazon stores the company name, or the c/o, or
postal boxes, etc. It appears as the first line of the address, but
you can't be sure what exactly it is (save you don't want to lose it).

Sometimes the street address is here, sometimes is empty.

=item AddressLine2

=item AddressFieldTwo

=item address2

This appears to be the regular street/number address line, sometimes.
Sometimes is in the address1. You just can't know, so you have to use
some euristics, like checking if they are both set, otherwise choosing
the first available to use as street address.

=item PostalCode

Postal code for this address.

=item City

City for this address.

=item Phone

=item PhoneNumber

Phone number for this address.

=item CountryCode

=item StateOrRegion
